DipCoatImage-FiniteDepth is a Python package to perform image analysis on the coating layer shape from the batch dip coating process with finite depth.

The image below shows how the finite depth dip coating is performed.

   Finite depth dip coating process; immersion, deposition, termination and fluid redistribution.

As the substrate is immersed into the bulk fluid and then drawn out, liquid layer is applied onto the substrate.
The termination of coating is characterised by the lower end effect of the layer, where the capillary bridge forms and soon ruptures.
After the coating layer is separated from the pool, capillary force makes the layer to change its shape by fluid redistribution.
