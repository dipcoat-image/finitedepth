.. _document:

Documentation
=============

Documentation used to be in numpy-style, but it is now being transitioned
into google-style as it binds better with sphinx-autoapi.

To generate document, go to ``doc`` directory and build html files.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd doc
    $ make html

Documents will be generated in ``doc/build/html`` directory.
``index.html`` file will lead you to main page.
